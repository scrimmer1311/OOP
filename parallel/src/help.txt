FIRST STAGE - THE NODE ADJACENCY EVALUATOR

@Author: Mullin G. D. MSU Sarov student, gr. VM-122

This program does
1) Construction of simplest mesh - quadric grid, with some elements
distinguished into triangles cells.
2) Evaluating the incidence of elements to nodes (EN) and incidence of
nodes to elements (NE) in CSR format (difficulty O(N)).
3) Resolving node adjacency (NN) matrix in CSR format (difficulty O(N^2)).

Modes by input args:
nothing: runs help.
1, string: file determined mode - the program opens parsed file:
	"*.txt" 
3, string: this mode parses the parameters:
	[Nx] [Ny] [V]
		Nx - X dimension of grid
	Ny - Y dimension of grid
	V - variant of division: 1 - / 2 - \
								/		\
	DEFAULT: K1 = 1 , K2 = 1
5, string: this mode parses the parameters:
	[Nx] [Ny] [V] [K1] [K2]
	Nx - X dimension of grid
	Ny - Y dimension of grid
	V - variant of division: 1 - / 2 - \
								/		\
	K1 - how many times (in order of grid cells) cell not divided
	K2 - how many times (in order of grid cells) cell divided
other variants: error

Output: file "output.txt"

Error codes:

1: no args provided, program throws help
-1: untraceable error
-2: only argument, wrong path to initials
-3: arguments conversion to integer numbers was failed or provided variant not equal to 1 or 2
-4:
